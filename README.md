**Problem Statement**: With the rise in the variety of cars with differentiated capabilities and features such as model, production year, category, brand, fuel type, engine volume, mileage, cylinders, colour, airbags and many more, comes forward a car price prediction challenge for all. Everyone aspires to own a car within budget with the best features available - to solve the price problem a dataset was created consisting of 19237 records in the training dataset and 8245 in the test dataset. 

**Objective**: Predict the price of the car given the features

**Problem Type**: Regression

**Evaluation Metric**: Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSLE)

**Target Column**: Price

**Tools/Techniques used**: Python, Feature Engineering and transformation, Stacking Ensemble
